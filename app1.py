# --- ABOUT US SECTION ---

st.markdown("""
Team Members: Nithin G, Mohammed Shoaib, Tarun P and Raksha R

We are a team of four 2nd-year Information Science students from JSS Science and Technology University, Mysuru.  
Our shared interest in Artificial Intelligence and its applications in agriculture led us to develop this project ‚Äî  
**"Tomato Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning"**.

This project was built collaboratively, where team members contributed to model development, frontend design, backend integration, and data handling.  
Our goal is to leverage AI to support farmers and researchers in identifying tomato plant diseases early, effectively, and efficiently.
